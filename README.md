# Toolto Predict Used Car Prices

## Motivation
The inspiration for this project stems from the need to design a model capable of predicting the prices of used cars. This model can assist customers in determining if they are purchasing a car at a fair price.

## Description
This model utilizes a dataset containing the following features: Price, Year, Mileage, Model, Brand, City, and State. The information is sourced from the United States. The model is trained on machine learning algorithms that iteratively learn with each new piece of data added. A web page with a map interface allows users to input model, year, state, and mileage to receive a price estimate.

## Construction of the Model
