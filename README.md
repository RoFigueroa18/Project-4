## Model to Predict Used Car prices

#Motivation
The idea of this project came with designing a model that could predict prices of used cars. This model may help customers know if they are buying a car to a rightful price. 

#Description

This model uses a dataset that contains: Price, Year, Mileage, Model, Brand, City, State. 
Is information from the United States.
In a page with a map you will be able to have a model, year, state mileage and have a price using this information. 
The model is a train machine learning model, that for each iteration and for each new information added will learn.
